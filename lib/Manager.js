// TODO: Write code to define and export the Manager class. HINT: This class should inherit from Employee.

// REQUIRE IN HERE

//Do you create an object (?) of manager as below? or is there some subclass method?
// const Manager = new Employee (actual parameters for a made up person?)

//employee class code is:
// class Employee {
//     constructor (Id, Name, Role, Email, otherInfo) {
//         this.Id = Id;
//         this.name = Name;
//         this.Role = Role;
//         this.email = Email;
//         this.otherInfo = otherInfo;
//     }

// }

//right now I have an otherInfo property (?) in the Employee class, is this going to get an Office number in the manager subclass?

//is the below the only thing to export? No capitalisation? Syntax same for a subclass?
module.exports = manager;
