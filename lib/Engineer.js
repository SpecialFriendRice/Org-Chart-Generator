// TODO: Write code to define and export the Engineer class.  HINT: This class should inherit from Employee.

//employee class code is:
// class Employee {
//     constructor (ID, name, jobTitle, email, otherInfo) {
//         this.Id = Id;
//         this.name = name;
//         this.email = email;
//         this.otherInfo = otherInfo;
//     }

// }

//right now I have an otherInfo property (?) in the Employee class, is this going to get a GitHub username property in the Engineer subclass?

//is the below the only thing to export? No capitalisation? Syntax same for a subclass?
module.exports = engineer;
