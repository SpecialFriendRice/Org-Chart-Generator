    //a PERSON OBJECT needs to be created which will have three prototypes (?)
    // Manager, Engineer and Intern
    // Each person needs their name and email address from prompt
    // Each person needs to choose job title from list of three: Manager, Engineer and Intern
    // Manager will be asked for their office number
    // Engineer will be asked for their GitHub username
    // Intern will be asked for their school/Uni
    // ID is autogenerated for each person
